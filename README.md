# Newberry-part-books
Symbolic music files for Verdelot madrigals as found in the Newberry partbooks.

# Original material
The transcriptions of these madrigals are based upon the Newberry partbooks from the Newberry library (Cantus, Tenor, Quintus, Bassus: VAULT Case MS minus VM 1578 .M91). Since the altus part is missing from this colelction, we also relied upon H. Colin Slim's *A Gift of Madrigals and Motets* vol.2 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1972) as well as upon Sutton Coldfied's *Ten Altus Parts at Oscott College* ([place of publication non identified]: Sutton Coldfield Oscott College, 1978), transcribed and edited by H. Colin Slim.
